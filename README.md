Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/goodreads-clone.git
cd goodreads-clone
2. Create a Virtual Environment
Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install the Requirements
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Apply Migrations
bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
5. Run the Development Server
bash

python manage.py runserver
Then, open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see the app running locally.

6. Create a Superuser
To access the Django admin interface and manage books/users, create a superuser:

python manage.py createsuperuser
7. Add Books via Admin Panel
Once logged in, you can access the Django admin panel at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/, where you can add books, authors, and genres.

Future Improvements
Implement a recommendation algorithm for suggesting books to users.
Add social features like following other users and seeing their reading lists.
Integration with third-party APIs for fetching book data (e.g., Google Books API).
